      <h3>Ans 1:</h3>
      <p>
        JavaScript is a versatile and powerful programming language that is
        primarily used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites. It
        is a key technology in web development and is supported by all major web
        browsers.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>1. Client-Side Scripting:</strong> JavaScript is mainly used for
        client-side scripting, meaning it runs in the user's web browser rather
        than on the server. This allows developers to create dynamic and
        interactive user interfaces.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>2. Web Browser Compatibility:</strong> JavaScript is supported
        by all major web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and
        others. This widespread support makes it a standard choice for
        client-side scripting in web development. 3.Interactivity: JavaScript
        enables the creation of interactive elements on web pages. Developers
        can use it to respond to user actions, such as clicks, form submissions,
        and keyboard input, to update the content and appearance of a web page
        in real-time without requiring a page reload.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>3. DOM Manipulation: </strong>The Document Object Model (DOM) is
        a programming interface for web documents. JavaScript allows developers
        to manipulate the DOM, which represents the structure of a web page.
        This manipulation enables dynamic updates to the content and structure
        of a webpage.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>4. Event Handling:</strong> JavaScript can respond to various
        events triggered by user actions or other sources, such as timers and
        network requests. This event-driven nature is crucial for creating
        responsive and interactive web applications.

      <h3>Ans 2:</h3>
      <p>
        JavaScript and HTML are both crucial technologies for web development,
        but they serve different purposes and have distinct roles in the
        creation of web pages
      </p>
      <h2>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):</h2>
      <p>
        - HTML is a markup language used for structuring content on the web.
        <br />
        - It defines the structure and presentation of the content, such as
        text, images, links, and other elements. <br />
        - HTML is used to create the basic structure of a web page. <br />
        - It defines the layout, headings, paragraphs, lists, images, links, and
        other static content. <br>
        <h2>JavaScript:</h2>
        <p>- JavaScript is a programming language used for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. <br>
            - It allows you to manipulate the content of a web page, respond to user actions, and update the page without requiring a full reload. <br>
            - JavaScript is used to add dynamic behavior to web pages. <br>
           - It can handle user input, modify HTML content on the fly, make asynchronous requests to servers (AJAX), and create interactive features like sliders, pop-ups, and form validation.
        </p>
      </p>

      <h3>Ans 3:</h3>
      <p>JavaScript has several primitive data types, which are basic building blocks for constructing more complex data structures.</p>
      <p><strong>Number:</strong>Represents numeric values (integers or floating-point numbers)</p>
      <p><strong>String :</strong>Represents sequences of characters (text)</p>
      <p><strong>Boolean:</strong>Represents a logical entity with two values: true or false.</p>
      <p><strong>Undefined:</strong>Represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value.</p>
      <p><strong>Null:</strong>Represents the intentional absence of any object value.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Ans 4:</h3>
      <p>In JavaScript, variables are used to store and manage data. They allow developers to name a piece of data so that it can be easily referenced and manipulated throughout a program. Variables provide a way to store information and work with values of different types. The let keyword is one of the ways to declare variables in JavaScript.</p>
      <div>
         Declaring variables : <br>
         <strong>
            let firstName; <br>
          let lastName = "Smith"; <br>
          let age = 30;
         </strong>
          </div>
          <hr>
          <h3>Ans 5:</h3>   
         <p>Comments in JavaScript are essential for code documentation and readability. They provide explanatory notes within the code that are ignored by the JavaScript interpreter. Comments are useful for developers (including yourself) to understand the purpose of code, document functions, clarify complex logic, and leave remarks for future reference. Here are examples of single-line and multi-line comments in JavaScript</p> 
         <h2>Single-line Comments:</h2>
         <p>Single-line comments start with "//" and extend to the end of the line. They are commonly used for brief explanations or comments on a single line of code.</p>
         <h2>Multi-line Comments:</h2>
         <p>Multi-line comments are enclosed between  "/* and */" and can span multiple lines. They are useful for more extensive explanations, commenting out blocks of code temporarily, or providing context for larger sections of code.</p>
         <hr>
         <h3>Ans 6:</h3>
         <p><strong>Introduction:</strong>Choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript is crucial for code readability and maintainability. Well-named variables make the code self-explanatory, reducing the need for extensive comments and making it easier for developers (including yourself) to understand the purpose and functionality of the code.</p>
         <p><strong>1.Readability:</strong>Clear and descriptive variable names make the code more readable. When someone (including yourself) reads the code, they can quickly grasp the purpose of variables and their role in the overall logic.</p>
         <p><strong>2.Understanding Intent:</strong>Meaningful variable names convey the intent of the code. They provide insight into what the variable is meant to represent or store, leading to better comprehension of the underlying logic.</p>
         <p><strong>3.Maintenance:</strong>As code evolves, developers need to make updates, fixes, or improvements. Descriptive variable names simplify the maintenance process by reducing the likelihood of introducing errors or unintended behavior during modifications.</p>
