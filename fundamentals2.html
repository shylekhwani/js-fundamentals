        Operators in JavaScript are symbols or keywords that perform operations
        on one or more operands. These operations can include arithmetic
        calculations, logical evaluations, assignment, comparison, and more.
        Operators are a fundamental part of any programming language, including
        JavaScript, and they play a crucial role in expressing and manipulating
        data within your code.

        <strong>Arithmetic Operators:</strong>Arithmetic operators perform
        mathematical calculations on numeric values.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Assignment Operators:</strong>Assignment operators assign values
        to variables.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Comparison Operators:</strong>Comparison operators compare
        values and return a Boolean result.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Logical Operators:</strong>Logical operators perform logical
        operations and return a Boolean result.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Increment and Decrement Operators:</strong>Increment (++) and
        decrement (--) operators increase or decrease the value of a variable by
        1.

        <strong>Introduction</strong>In JavaScript, operators are categorized
        based on the number of operands they act upon. The three main categories
        are unary, binary, and ternary operators.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong> Unary Operators:</strong>Unary operators are operators that
        perform an operation on a single operand. They require only one value to
        operate upon.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Binary Operators:</strong>Binary operators are operators that
        perform an operation on two operands. They require two values to operate
        upon.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong> Ternary Operator:</strong>The ternary operator is a unique
        operator in JavaScript that takes three operands. It is often used as a
        shorthand for an if-else statement.
